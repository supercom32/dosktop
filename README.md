# Dosktop

Dosktop is a package which allow users to easily create rich text-based terminal
applications and games. Dosktop differs from other terminal packages by
providing an extremely simple API that abstracts out all low-level terminal
operations, while avoiding complicated event-driven TUI designs.

# Features

* Straight forward BASIC-like API and syntax!
* Access to an unlimited number of independent text layers, allowing for modal dialogs, windows, parallax scrolling, forgrounds, backgrounds, and more!
* Automatic calculation of shadows and colored transparencies effects!
* High level support for buttons, selection menus, lines, frames, and other TUI controls!
* Full manual and automatic mouse support with TUI integration!
* Dialog text printing with automatic word wrapping, typewriter effects, and dynamic style markup!
* Virtual File System (ZIP & RAR) support, with password protection to ensure resource integrity!
* Automatic conversion and rendering of bitmap images directly to text layers in ansi graphics!

# Project status

While Dosktop is currently being actively developed, it is at a point where practical use 
will determine further areas of usability, existing gaps, and deficiency improvements. If you 
like what this package has to offer, have ideas on how to improve it, or just want to
experiment, consider giving Dosktop a try! 

# Future Roadmap

* More examples and documentation.
* More TUI controls (Progress bars, loading icons, etc).
* Bulk addition of images and selections.
* Saving and loading of terminal screenshots.
* Fully text-based sprite system.
* Digital audio and sound integration.
